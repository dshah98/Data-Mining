       "  'review': 'As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple’s AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  If you’re new to the world of Apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods:1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge.2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “Transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I’ve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad.So, Let’s Focus on the AirPods Pro Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple’s “Find My” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I’d say the “FindMy” capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. But I’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let’s get into some facts.What’s in the box?  First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you’ll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation.Features With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.Comfort and Convenience Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones.Noise Cancellation and Transparency ModeLiving in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.Sweatproof I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I’ve subjected them to. It’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency.Battery life and Charging case While I haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.Alright, but how do they sound? My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so I’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration. Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven’t had the feeling that I’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own.Wrapping Up If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. With that said, if you’ve decided it’s time to track-down a pair for yourself, I suggest shopping around. While prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles I’ve skimmed mentioned that Amazon occasionally offers much-better AirPods and AirPods Pro deals than Apple.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it\\'s time to drop some comments.  For context I\\'m coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I\\'ve also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro.== Noise Cancellation==Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don\\'t get the \"true wireless\" marketing term (I didn\\'t and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don\\'t  have a wire between the two ear buds.Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn\\'t entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I\\'d say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s.Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I\\'ve had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them.== Sound Quality ==We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don\\'t even compete.I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I\\'ve adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify\\'s settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the \"Flat\" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump.Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too.== Form Factor ==Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc. These buds are really light and it\\'s easy to forget they\\'re in you ears!  So tiny they\\'re a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case.Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a \"check fit\" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings.== Battery Life ==I don\\'t have these in all day but I\\'d say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I\\'ve gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience.== Connectivity ==CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That\\'s not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must\\'ve made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I\\'m impressed!== Surprise Feature ==I wasn\\'t particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn\\'t really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It\\'s really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk.== Other Buggy Stuff ==Apart from the things I\\'ve listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I\\'ve had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won\\'t let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone).This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple\\'s quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it\\'s what I do for a living) but you don\\'t release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they\\'re simpler functionality, but still.== Bottom Line ==In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don\\'t work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you\\'re going to over pay on the expectation you\\'re going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn\\'t quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought the AirPods Pro when they came out. I had the first AirPods which, although didn’t sound great, where easy to use and carry, and I thought had a great microphone. Although the Pros are much better, I’ve always had a problem with them: they fall of my ears. I just got the new Comply 2.0 tips for them yesterday, which prompted me to write this review. By the way, so far, the tips are great. The Pros sound better, and have stayed in my ears.I also have the Sony WF 1000XM3, which, as much as I like them, also fall off my ears.The “ear falling” problem led me to try the Bose.Sound:I tried a number of songs on all 3. I streamed the music from Tidal Hi Fi, so they’re all at higher resolutions.  I’ll list some here:1. Are you even real? James Blake - this song sounded terrible on the Bose. Muffled to the point that I wonder if these headphones are working correctly. As you might have read, the Bose Music app doesn’t have an equalizer, so there’s nothing you can do on this one. On the AirPods Pro, the song sounded much better than in the Bose. On the Sonys, about 3% better than in the Pros.2. Blinding Lights - The Weekend - This song came out great in all 3. Edge to Sony over the Bose, but not by much. It sounded tiniest on the Pros.3. Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra. This is a classic smooth jazz song. The Bose won this round. The song was expansive, lots of small details came out, it was great. I also played a couple of Joshua Redman songs, and I would say the Bose sounded better on those.  I feel that the Bose will probably play better jazz music, if that’s your thing.4. Malamente - Rosalia. The Sonys won this round going away. Once again, the Bose sounded a bit muffled. Song was good on the Pros, but perhaps a little bit too trebly.5. Paranoid Android - Radiohead. This song was really good on all 3, Bose was not that far off the Sonys.6. The Only Thing - Travis. This was another song that the Bose couldn’t play well either. Once again the tinny, muffled sound came up. It felt like i turned the music down on the headphones (I didn’t). Definitely better on the Sony and Pros.Overall, on music playing, I would rate the Sonys number 1, especially if you use Tidal. For my taste, the “360 reality audio” does make songs sound better. The Bose are number 2, but not by much over the AirPods Pro with the Comply tips. The new ios update that added the spatial sound to the Pros with the Comply tips has made, to my ears, a huge difference. In fact, if you don’t listen to jazz, you might prefer the Pros.Microphone/Phone callsI did several blind test calls with my partner, so she could tell me which one sounded better to her. In all tests, she said my voice sounded “about 70% better” (her number) with the AirPods Pro. She said that my voice sounded “feminine” (I’m male) with the Sony/Bose compared to the AirPods Pro.I then tested the Bose and the Sonys with her as well. She said that the Bose sounded better. For the record, I did a call with my parents with the Bose, and they never complained that they couldn’t hear my voice well. They have complained several times with the Sonys (as well as other people).As for hearing phone calls, to my ears, the AirPods Pro sound more natural. I would say that the Bose are second. Phone calls are the Sony’s weakest link. If you want to use the headphones mainly for phones, as much as I love the Sony’s for music, their microphone is just not good.FitAirPods Pro - the Pros have always felt comfortable to me. However, as I mentioned previously, the Pros routinely fall off my ears. They have fallen when I’m sitting on my desk, when I’m running, walking, or riding a bike. I NEVER had this problem with the original AirPods.The Comply tips arrived yesterday. I want to take them out on a run. For being in the house this past day, they’ve been a huge improvement. I’m glad I bought them.Sony - the Sonys fit comfortably in my ear. However, they will eventually fall off. This happens if I’m walking or exercising. I have to be checking them every few minutes.Bose - I will start with the good: they stay in my ears. I’ve tried them in the house so far, but they’ve been very stable. The bad: 2 things. (1) the tip flies off my ears. The small is too small to do anything. The medium and large just end up flapping, and have to adjust it. It’s very noticeable. (2) They hurt. They stay in my ear, but the seal is seemingly so tight that it hurts my earholes (the biology term is probably the concha). I used to have the old Bose Soundsport wired headphones, and the tip in those was incredibly comfortable and stable. I might be doing something wrong when putting them in, but this will probably lead me to return them. I won’t wear headphones, especially ones at this price, that hurt.Noise Cancelling:1. Bose - they did a fantastic job with this. I stood next to the dryer, and I could barely hear it. My partner stood next to me to talk to me, and I couldn’t hear her either. If I turned it off to 0, I could hear her, but even then, the seal is so tight that it wasn’t fully perfect. On noise cancelling, these are far and away the best. If that’s the most important thing to you, stop reading the review and order them now.2. AirPods Pro - I’ve always been amazed at how good the Pros block sound for their size. I’m looking forward to trying them outside with the Complys, as I think it will be even better. However, the Bose are better.3. Sony - the Sonys block a lot of outside noise as well. I don’t know if it’s better than the Pros, but it’s right there. Hard for me to pick a number 2 here.ConclusionIt’s possible that, if the Bose didn’t hurt my ears so much, that they could be the best overall set. I don’t like how some songs sound, but in others, it’s almost as good as the Sonys, which to me, are the standard. I actually have the Bowers Wilkins PX 7s, and I prefer how music sounds on the Sonys.  However, given the pain on my ears, this is how I would rate all of them:1. Music playing - Sony, Bose, AirPods Pro.2. Phone Calls - AirPods Pro, Bose, Sony. I will note that I get complaints on voice quality when using the PX7s as well.3.  Comfort - AirPods Pro with Comply tips, Sony, Bose (VERY last).4. Noise Cancelling - Bose (by a lot), AirPods Pro, Sony.',\n",

This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation.+. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had- no case display of battery life- BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice.-  big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable.+ quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on.+. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode. Granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything.  It would be more valuable if it was stronger.+. Siri interaction has proven positive however Alexa google et cetera are probably just as good.  So this is more of a neutral than a positive. Same with the looks of it.  Ninety percent of earbuds look good to me.- case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket+ however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket.- price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud.-  the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily.-  though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain.-  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago.+  after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds.-  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups.+. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable.+ i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by.-  I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. This was my first update of my review. I might do another update should I choose to just accept and keep these apPros for myself and not gift them to my sister.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700\\'s, which I\\'ve been using daily for a couple of months so I\\'ll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there\\'s nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It\\'s all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu.Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn\\'t seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don\\'t use so I didn\\'t test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else.For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won\\'t be disappointed.Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It\\'s hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they\\'re fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I\\'m not sure why they weren\\'t 100% if left in there overnight.There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can\\'t control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it\\'s okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface.There\\'s no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it\\'s been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There\\'s a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it\\'s hard to tell which mode you\\'re in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice.Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don\\'t have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I\\'ll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I\\'ve found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I\\'m guessing similar to previous AirPods.For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it\\'s just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive.For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don\\'t hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while.Would definitely recommend.',\n",

I recently was gifted some Apple Beats Pro in a pretty light purple color and I have to admit reluctantly that the quality is definitely not on par with Apple's AirPods Pro! I was honestly surprised. The AirPods pro battery life is superior as well as well as the fit in ear and noise cancellation abilities. I just feel like the Beats Pro are too bulky and I'm always aware of them being in my ear; whereas, I frequently forget the AirPods and AirPods pro are even in my ear because they just almost become a part of my body when I'm wearing them.

       "  'review': \"I want to start off by saying I am not a huge Apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.Pros:- Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building.- Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later.- Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them.- Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple.- Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that.Medicorities:- The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes.- The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.Cons:- Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan.- Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\",\n",
       "  'lower_summary': \"i want to start off by saying i am not a huge apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. i have a mix of products with different operating systems; i have a google pixel phone, an ipad, and a windows pc. these earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on windows, though of course they work the best with my ipad. i got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. i would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.pros:- sound. sound quality is really good for most music. i'm a bit of a bass head so i don't get the fullest experience i would like out of these, but i still enjoy the clarity of the music. i did not get these specifically for bass, as i knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. if you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- features. the anc on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. these block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. these do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). i am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and i can see the use cases for them only building.- comfort. honestly, with the relief of pressure apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the airpods, i forget these are in my ears. they are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. this may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which i will mention later.- portability. the charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it i can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. the airpods themselves are quite small and i can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other tws earbuds i've owned so hopefully i will be able to keep track of them.- seamlessness with apple products. airpods are, of course, apple made. therefore they are designed to work with iphones, ipads, macs, and macbooks. these pause and play instantaneously with my ipad and i can access all the special features you get specific to apple.- presentation. apple wins on sleekness. not much else to say about that.medicorities:- the fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. my left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering i can still get a good seal. they fall out if i lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. definitely try all the earbud sizes.- the magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so i find it sometimes opens when i carry them around. this doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.cons:- price. as i stated before i don't think these are worth $250. i think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the apple branding. this is why i'm not a huge apple fan.- not seamless with non-apple products. if you only use apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. i didn't expect these to work with everything, though an android app would be nice. if samsung can make an app for their galaxy buds for ios devices, i think apple can do the same for android. i have connection issues on occasion with my windows pc, and taking out and airpod does not in any way auto-pause/play on windows nor android. all stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. this is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.tl;dr i think that the pros outweigh the cons for the airpods pros, and i recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything apple, but from a competitive standpoint i get it. i can see myself using these on a daily basis and i think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll be comparing three different pairs of headphones, as any one of them would have top marks by themselves, and my review would be meaningless; With this price point they had better be decent headphones.The headphones I\\'ll be comparing are:Apple AirPods Pro (referred to as \"Air\" from here on),Sennheiser CX 400BT (referred to as \"CX\" from here on), andSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (referred to as \"MO\" from here on).Moving on.*Sound*All 3 sound great, but the MO was the clear winner, giving the most true-to-life sound, including all of the subtle highs and lows.The Air was a not-too-far-off second; it lacked some depth in the high notes.The CX wasn’t too far behind the Air; it had better sound, however, it had significant issues stemming from noise cancellation, see below.*Noise Cancellation*The Air definitely has the best noise cancellation, for me; it isn’t especially awesome, but it’s adequate for most situations. It’s probably about as good as you can expect in this price range, but cannot compare to over-ear headphones.The MO wasn’t too terribly far behind, and may even have better noise cancellation, but due to fitment issues, below, the seal wasn’t good enough to cancel out most of the noises around me.The CX has no noise cancellation. I didn’t realize how big of an issue this would be, but when I actually manage a decent seal on the ear buds, I can hear my own breathing (not a mouth-breather, by the way!) almost as loud as my music. This was the deal-killer for me. Otherwise the CX would be on par with the others, and at half the price.*Fitment*Both of the Sennheisers fit identically, and are a better fit, in that they actually stay in my ears. However, as stated above, the actual buds don’t fit my ears; I seem to be right between the small and medium buds. The Sennheisers kind of twist into your ear, and hold similar to a sport headphone, which is nice, but also a nuisance.The Air’s buds are a much better fit, but they don’t stay in my ears at all; The slightest movement and they fall out. I bought some “ear hooks” for them, and they stay in my ears perfectly, now. However, the ear hooks add just a hair of silicone to the exterior of the headphones, which caused me discomfort after a few hours (Note: this has nothing to do with the actual headphones).*Battery*I want to say the Sennheisers’ battery lasted way longer than the Airs (a full work day). That said, I did not pay attention to how long it took them to recharge in their case. The Airs seem to only last 6-8 hours (I should mention I have long work days, haha), but I watched their battery level for a couple minutes the first time I charged them, and they were charging about 1% per 10-15 seconds. Assuming it actually keeps that pace, that’s a full charge within 16-24 minutes, which seems pretty good to me. One charge drained the Air’s case by 20%, so you get 5 charges out of it. Unfortunately, I don’t recall most of this stuff with the Sennheisers.*Technology*I’d say that none of them stand out as being better here, just different. The Sennheisers might have a slight upper hand, as they have more controls available to them, but some of them make no sense to me, and there’s no way to reprogram them (as far as I can tell. It may be possible via their app, but I imagine this is specific to the device, and I want them to work the same on all devices. Also, both Sennheisers have issues with the fact that all controls are right on the face of the headphone, and it’s almost impossible to put them in your ears without touching the face.The Airs CAN’T CONTROL VOLUME! For real?! You have to control it from your phone/listening device. This absolutely drives me nuts (at least 20 times a day). The Airs actually has a button on the stem that you have to push for all of the controls. I was under the impression it felt seamless, similar to a touchscreen; Not the case. Lastly, based on their product description and reviews, it seemed that the Airs can only connect to Apple products, but based on their incredibly short manual, it would appear that it can indeed connect to any bluetooth device (unfortunately all I own are Apple products, so I can’t verify this).All 3 headphones pause your music when you take them out, which is nice. I sure wish I could turn them off (without putting them in their case), but none of them allow this.*Summary*For myself, I opted to return the Sennheisers, and plan to stick with the Air. The Sennheisers had more significant issues involving fit and noise cancellation, and the Air has more significant issues with the interface (no volume control), and don’t stay in your ears without outside assistance via ear hooks.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple’s AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  If you’re new to the world of Apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods:1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge.2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “Transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I’ve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad.So, Let’s Focus on the AirPods Pro Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple’s “Find My” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I’d say the “FindMy” capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. But I’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let’s get into some facts.What’s in the box?  First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you’ll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation.Features With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.Comfort and Convenience Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones.Noise Cancellation and Transparency ModeLiving in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.Sweatproof I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I’ve subjected them to. It’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency.Battery life and Charging case While I haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.Alright, but how do they sound? My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so I’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration. Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven’t had the feeling that I’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own.Wrapping Up If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. With that said, if you’ve decided it’s time to track-down a pair for yourself, I suggest shopping around. While prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles I’ve skimmed mentioned that Amazon occasionally offers much-better AirPods and AirPods Pro deals than Apple.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it\\'s time to drop some comments.  For context I\\'m coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I\\'ve also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro.== Noise Cancellation==Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don\\'t get the \"true wireless\" marketing term (I didn\\'t and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don\\'t  have a wire between the two ear buds.Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn\\'t entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I\\'d say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s.Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I\\'ve had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them.== Sound Quality ==We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don\\'t even compete.I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I\\'ve adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify\\'s settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the \"Flat\" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump.Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too.== Form Factor ==Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc. These buds are really light and it\\'s easy to forget they\\'re in you ears!  So tiny they\\'re a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case.Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a \"check fit\" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings.== Battery Life ==I don\\'t have these in all day but I\\'d say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I\\'ve gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience.== Connectivity ==CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That\\'s not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must\\'ve made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I\\'m impressed!== Surprise Feature ==I wasn\\'t particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn\\'t really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It\\'s really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk.== Other Buggy Stuff ==Apart from the things I\\'ve listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I\\'ve had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won\\'t let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone).This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple\\'s quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it\\'s what I do for a living) but you don\\'t release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they\\'re simpler functionality, but still.== Bottom Line ==In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don\\'t work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you\\'re going to over pay on the expectation you\\'re going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn\\'t quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought the AirPods Pro when they came out. I had the first AirPods which, although didn’t sound great, where easy to use and carry, and I thought had a great microphone. Although the Pros are much better, I’ve always had a problem with them: they fall of my ears. I just got the new Comply 2.0 tips for them yesterday, which prompted me to write this review. By the way, so far, the tips are great. The Pros sound better, and have stayed in my ears.I also have the Sony WF 1000XM3, which, as much as I like them, also fall off my ears.The “ear falling” problem led me to try the Bose.Sound:I tried a number of songs on all 3. I streamed the music from Tidal Hi Fi, so they’re all at higher resolutions.  I’ll list some here:1. Are you even real? James Blake - this song sounded terrible on the Bose. Muffled to the point that I wonder if these headphones are working correctly. As you might have read, the Bose Music app doesn’t have an equalizer, so there’s nothing you can do on this one. On the AirPods Pro, the song sounded much better than in the Bose. On the Sonys, about 3% better than in the Pros.2. Blinding Lights - The Weekend - This song came out great in all 3. Edge to Sony over the Bose, but not by much. It sounded tiniest on the Pros.3. Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra. This is a classic smooth jazz song. The Bose won this round. The song was expansive, lots of small details came out, it was great. I also played a couple of Joshua Redman songs, and I would say the Bose sounded better on those.  I feel that the Bose will probably play better jazz music, if that’s your thing.4. Malamente - Rosalia. The Sonys won this round going away. Once again, the Bose sounded a bit muffled. Song was good on the Pros, but perhaps a little bit too trebly.5. Paranoid Android - Radiohead. This song was really good on all 3, Bose was not that far off the Sonys.6. The Only Thing - Travis. This was another song that the Bose couldn’t play well either. Once again the tinny, muffled sound came up. It felt like i turned the music down on the headphones (I didn’t). Definitely better on the Sony and Pros.Overall, on music playing, I would rate the Sonys number 1, especially if you use Tidal. For my taste, the “360 reality audio” does make songs sound better. The Bose are number 2, but not by much over the AirPods Pro with the Comply tips. The new ios update that added the spatial sound to the Pros with the Comply tips has made, to my ears, a huge difference. In fact, if you don’t listen to jazz, you might prefer the Pros.Microphone/Phone callsI did several blind test calls with my partner, so she could tell me which one sounded better to her. In all tests, she said my voice sounded “about 70% better” (her number) with the AirPods Pro. She said that my voice sounded “feminine” (I’m male) with the Sony/Bose compared to the AirPods Pro.I then tested the Bose and the Sonys with her as well. She said that the Bose sounded better. For the record, I did a call with my parents with the Bose, and they never complained that they couldn’t hear my voice well. They have complained several times with the Sonys (as well as other people).As for hearing phone calls, to my ears, the AirPods Pro sound more natural. I would say that the Bose are second. Phone calls are the Sony’s weakest link. If you want to use the headphones mainly for phones, as much as I love the Sony’s for music, their microphone is just not good.FitAirPods Pro - the Pros have always felt comfortable to me. However, as I mentioned previously, the Pros routinely fall off my ears. They have fallen when I’m sitting on my desk, when I’m running, walking, or riding a bike. I NEVER had this problem with the original AirPods.The Comply tips arrived yesterday. I want to take them out on a run. For being in the house this past day, they’ve been a huge improvement. I’m glad I bought them.Sony - the Sonys fit comfortably in my ear. However, they will eventually fall off. This happens if I’m walking or exercising. I have to be checking them every few minutes.Bose - I will start with the good: they stay in my ears. I’ve tried them in the house so far, but they’ve been very stable. The bad: 2 things. (1) the tip flies off my ears. The small is too small to do anything. The medium and large just end up flapping, and have to adjust it. It’s very noticeable. (2) They hurt. They stay in my ear, but the seal is seemingly so tight that it hurts my earholes (the biology term is probably the concha). I used to have the old Bose Soundsport wired headphones, and the tip in those was incredibly comfortable and stable. I might be doing something wrong when putting them in, but this will probably lead me to return them. I won’t wear headphones, especially ones at this price, that hurt.Noise Cancelling:1. Bose - they did a fantastic job with this. I stood next to the dryer, and I could barely hear it. My partner stood next to me to talk to me, and I couldn’t hear her either. If I turned it off to 0, I could hear her, but even then, the seal is so tight that it wasn’t fully perfect. On noise cancelling, these are far and away the best. If that’s the most important thing to you, stop reading the review and order them now.2. AirPods Pro - I’ve always been amazed at how good the Pros block sound for their size. I’m looking forward to trying them outside with the Complys, as I think it will be even better. However, the Bose are better.3. Sony - the Sonys block a lot of outside noise as well. I don’t know if it’s better than the Pros, but it’s right there. Hard for me to pick a number 2 here.ConclusionIt’s possible that, if the Bose didn’t hurt my ears so much, that they could be the best overall set. I don’t like how some songs sound, but in others, it’s almost as good as the Sonys, which to me, are the standard. I actually have the Bowers Wilkins PX 7s, and I prefer how music sounds on the Sonys.  However, given the pain on my ears, this is how I would rate all of them:1. Music playing - Sony, Bose, AirPods Pro.2. Phone Calls - AirPods Pro, Bose, Sony. I will note that I get complaints on voice quality when using the PX7s as well.3.  Comfort - AirPods Pro with Comply tips, Sony, Bose (VERY last).4. Noise Cancelling - Bose (by a lot), AirPods Pro, Sony.',\n",

I was worried about them falling out but they do a great job of staying in your ears. I've only found an issue if a big chunk of my hair brushes them that they might come loose but otherwise I've rarely ever had them come out on their own. They last their told 4 hours or so and the case continues to charge them for longer. I wear them all day. Calls work well too on android and they even reduce background noise.

This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation.+. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had- no case display of battery life- BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice.-  big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable.+ quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on.+. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode. Granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything.  It would be more valuable if it was stronger.+. Siri interaction has proven positive however Alexa google et cetera are probably just as good.  So this is more of a neutral than a positive. Same with the looks of it.  Ninety percent of earbuds look good to me.- case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket+ however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket.- price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud.-  the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily.-  though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain.-  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago.+  after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds.-  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups.+. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable.+ i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by.-  I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. This was my first update of my review. I might do another update should I choose to just accept and keep these apPros for myself and not gift them to my sister.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700\\'s, which I\\'ve been using daily for a couple of months so I\\'ll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there\\'s nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It\\'s all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu.Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn\\'t seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don\\'t use so I didn\\'t test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else.For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won\\'t be disappointed.Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It\\'s hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they\\'re fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I\\'m not sure why they weren\\'t 100% if left in there overnight.There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can\\'t control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it\\'s okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface.There\\'s no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it\\'s been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There\\'s a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it\\'s hard to tell which mode you\\'re in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice.Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don\\'t have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I\\'ll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I\\'ve found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I\\'m guessing similar to previous AirPods.For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it\\'s just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive.For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don\\'t hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while.Would definitely recommend.',\n",

I have the first generation Apple airpods which are about 5 years old and still great and functional and now I have the Apple AirPods Pro and the quality is there as usual! Nice quality case that feels expensive and durable. I recently was gifted some Apple Beats Pro in a pretty light purple color and I have to admit reluctantly that the quality is definitely not on par with Apple's AirPods Pro! I was honestly surprised. The AirPods pro battery life is superior as well as well as the fit in ear and noise cancellation abilities. I just feel like the Beats Pro are too bulky and I'm always aware of them being in my ear; whereas, I frequently forget the AirPods and AirPods pro are even in my ear because they just almost become a part of my body when I'm wearing them. Price is great and these are the best headphones on the market right now in my opinion as far as fit, sound, noise cancellation and overall quality materials are concerned.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I want to start off by saying I am not a huge Apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.Pros:- Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building.- Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later.- Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them.- Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple.- Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that.Medicorities:- The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes.- The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.Cons:- Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan.- Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll be comparing three different pairs of headphones, as any one of them would have top marks by themselves, and my review would be meaningless; With this price point they had better be decent headphones.The headphones I\\'ll be comparing are:Apple AirPods Pro (referred to as \"Air\" from here on),Sennheiser CX 400BT (referred to as \"CX\" from here on), andSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (referred to as \"MO\" from here on).Moving on.*Sound*All 3 sound great, but the MO was the clear winner, giving the most true-to-life sound, including all of the subtle highs and lows.The Air was a not-too-far-off second; it lacked some depth in the high notes.The CX wasn’t too far behind the Air; it had better sound, however, it had significant issues stemming from noise cancellation, see below.*Noise Cancellation*The Air definitely has the best noise cancellation, for me; it isn’t especially awesome, but it’s adequate for most situations. It’s probably about as good as you can expect in this price range, but cannot compare to over-ear headphones.The MO wasn’t too terribly far behind, and may even have better noise cancellation, but due to fitment issues, below, the seal wasn’t good enough to cancel out most of the noises around me.The CX has no noise cancellation. I didn’t realize how big of an issue this would be, but when I actually manage a decent seal on the ear buds, I can hear my own breathing (not a mouth-breather, by the way!) almost as loud as my music. This was the deal-killer for me. Otherwise the CX would be on par with the others, and at half the price.*Fitment*Both of the Sennheisers fit identically, and are a better fit, in that they actually stay in my ears. However, as stated above, the actual buds don’t fit my ears; I seem to be right between the small and medium buds. The Sennheisers kind of twist into your ear, and hold similar to a sport headphone, which is nice, but also a nuisance.The Air’s buds are a much better fit, but they don’t stay in my ears at all; The slightest movement and they fall out. I bought some “ear hooks” for them, and they stay in my ears perfectly, now. However, the ear hooks add just a hair of silicone to the exterior of the headphones, which caused me discomfort after a few hours (Note: this has nothing to do with the actual headphones).*Battery*I want to say the Sennheisers’ battery lasted way longer than the Airs (a full work day). That said, I did not pay attention to how long it took them to recharge in their case. The Airs seem to only last 6-8 hours (I should mention I have long work days, haha), but I watched their battery level for a couple minutes the first time I charged them, and they were charging about 1% per 10-15 seconds. Assuming it actually keeps that pace, that’s a full charge within 16-24 minutes, which seems pretty good to me. One charge drained the Air’s case by 20%, so you get 5 charges out of it. Unfortunately, I don’t recall most of this stuff with the Sennheisers.*Technology*I’d say that none of them stand out as being better here, just different. The Sennheisers might have a slight upper hand, as they have more controls available to them, but some of them make no sense to me, and there’s no way to reprogram them (as far as I can tell. It may be possible via their app, but I imagine this is specific to the device, and I want them to work the same on all devices. Also, both Sennheisers have issues with the fact that all controls are right on the face of the headphone, and it’s almost impossible to put them in your ears without touching the face.The Airs CAN’T CONTROL VOLUME! For real?! You have to control it from your phone/listening device. This absolutely drives me nuts (at least 20 times a day). The Airs actually has a button on the stem that you have to push for all of the controls. I was under the impression it felt seamless, similar to a touchscreen; Not the case. Lastly, based on their product description and reviews, it seemed that the Airs can only connect to Apple products, but based on their incredibly short manual, it would appear that it can indeed connect to any bluetooth device (unfortunately all I own are Apple products, so I can’t verify this).All 3 headphones pause your music when you take them out, which is nice. I sure wish I could turn them off (without putting them in their case), but none of them allow this.*Summary*For myself, I opted to return the Sennheisers, and plan to stick with the Air. The Sennheisers had more significant issues involving fit and noise cancellation, and the Air has more significant issues with the interface (no volume control), and don’t stay in your ears without outside assistance via ear hooks.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple’s AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  If you’re new to the world of Apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods:1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge.2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “Transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I’ve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad.So, Let’s Focus on the AirPods Pro Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple’s “Find My” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I’d say the “FindMy” capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. But I’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let’s get into some facts.What’s in the box?  First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you’ll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation.Features With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.Comfort and Convenience Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones.Noise Cancellation and Transparency ModeLiving in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.Sweatproof I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I’ve subjected them to. It’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency.Battery life and Charging case While I haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.Alright, but how do they sound? My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so I’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration. Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven’t had the feeling that I’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own.Wrapping Up If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds.

       "  'lower_summary': 'as i sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of apple’s airpods pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time i write a review for these bad boys, because i’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  if you’re new to the world of apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some apple products, like iphones and ipods:1: airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some apple devices. these airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. they come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your airpods, and accepts the standard lightning usb cable to charge.2: airpods pro, which have all of the features at the standard airpods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: lastly, apple added the airpods max to their fleet this year. these are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the airpods pro, minus the charging case. you’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the airpods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.please note: while the cases for the airpods and airpods pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. with that said, i’ve only btested the airpods pro with the lightning cable, as i do not own a wireless charging pad.so, let’s focus on the airpods pro keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, i absolutely love my airpods pro, and i take them with me just about everywhere. i’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why i love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. if you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. with that said, the airpods pro are capable of being used with apple’s “find my” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. keep in mind that i’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but i just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; i’d say the “findmy” capability is more of an afterthought that apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. but i’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. let’s get into some facts.what’s in the box?  first of all, the packaging for the airpods pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as apple has grown into the titan of a company that it is. it’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. inside the box, you’ll find your airpods pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to usb-c cable, and some documentation.features with the price being around 80dollars more than the airpods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the airpods pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.comfort and convenience being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the airpods pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. with only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the airpods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. the only feature that tops the comfort of the airpods pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. on top of these two stand-out features, voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ tts output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other bluetooth headphones.noise cancellation and transparency modeliving in the heart of the city, i constantly switch between the two modes while i travel with my cane, as i come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when i’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where i can block-out the sounds of the city while i make my way to my next crossing. and, while the noise cancellation of the airpods pro is incredible for their size, i do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the bose noise cancelling 700 headphones. and if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.on the other hand, when in transparency mode, the airpods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. and when i say unimpeded, i mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity i haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.sweatproof i also wear my airpods pro when i lift weights, and on my way both to and from my brazilian jiu-jitsu gym: two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything i’ve subjected them to. it’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. i haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the airpods resiliency.battery life and charging case while i haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article i found stated that the standard airpods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the airpos pro will survive for 5.5 hours. do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.alright, but how do they sound? my airpods pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether i’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. they are undeniably the best pair of earbuds i’ve ever owned, and i’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard bluetooth earbuds at times when my airpods pro are charging. spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so i’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless i have an unstable wi-fi connection. and, the airpods pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration. finally, when listening to music, the airpods pro have a surprising amount of power; i haven’t had the feeling that i’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. however, when in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, i do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  bose headphones, because i can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own.wrapping up if you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, i can’t recommend the airpods pro enough. while i do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to apple products, and i feel like i’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. with that said, if you’ve decided it’s time to track-down a pair for yourself, i suggest shopping around. while prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles i’ve skimmed mentioned that amazon occasionally offers much-better airpods and airpods pro deals than apple.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'m about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it\\'s time to drop some comments.  For context I\\'m coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I\\'ve also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro.== Noise Cancellation==Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don\\'t get the \"true wireless\" marketing term (I didn\\'t and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don\\'t  have a wire between the two ear buds.Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn\\'t entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I\\'d say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s.Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I\\'ve had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them.== Sound Quality ==We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don\\'t even compete.I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I\\'ve adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify\\'s settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the \"Flat\" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump.Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too.== Form Factor ==Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc. These buds are really light and it\\'s easy to forget they\\'re in you ears!  So tiny they\\'re a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case.Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a \"check fit\" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings.== Battery Life ==I don\\'t have these in all day but I\\'d say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I\\'ve gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience.== Connectivity ==CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That\\'s not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must\\'ve made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I\\'m impressed!== Surprise Feature ==I wasn\\'t particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn\\'t really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It\\'s really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk.== Other Buggy Stuff ==Apart from the things I\\'ve listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I\\'ve had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won\\'t let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone).This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple\\'s quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it\\'s what I do for a living) but you don\\'t release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they\\'re simpler functionality, but still.== Bottom Line ==In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don\\'t work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you\\'re going to over pay on the expectation you\\'re going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn\\'t quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought the AirPods Pro when they came out. I had the first AirPods which, although didn’t sound great, where easy to use and carry, and I thought had a great microphone. Although the Pros are much better, I’ve always had a problem with them: they fall of my ears. I just got the new Comply 2.0 tips for them yesterday, which prompted me to write this review. By the way, so far, the tips are great. The Pros sound better, and have stayed in my ears.I also have the Sony WF 1000XM3, which, as much as I like them, also fall off my ears.The “ear falling” problem led me to try the Bose.Sound:I tried a number of songs on all 3. I streamed the music from Tidal Hi Fi, so they’re all at higher resolutions.  I’ll list some here:1. Are you even real? James Blake - this song sounded terrible on the Bose. Muffled to the point that I wonder if these headphones are working correctly. As you might have read, the Bose Music app doesn’t have an equalizer, so there’s nothing you can do on this one. On the AirPods Pro, the song sounded much better than in the Bose. On the Sonys, about 3% better than in the Pros.2. Blinding Lights - The Weekend - This song came out great in all 3. Edge to Sony over the Bose, but not by much. It sounded tiniest on the Pros.3. Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra. This is a classic smooth jazz song. The Bose won this round. The song was expansive, lots of small details came out, it was great. I also played a couple of Joshua Redman songs, and I would say the Bose sounded better on those.  I feel that the Bose will probably play better jazz music, if that’s your thing.4. Malamente - Rosalia. The Sonys won this round going away. Once again, the Bose sounded a bit muffled. Song was good on the Pros, but perhaps a little bit too trebly.5. Paranoid Android - Radiohead. This song was really good on all 3, Bose was not that far off the Sonys.6. The Only Thing - Travis. This was another song that the Bose couldn’t play well either. Once again the tinny, muffled sound came up. It felt like i turned the music down on the headphones (I didn’t). Definitely better on the Sony and Pros.Overall, on music playing, I would rate the Sonys number 1, especially if you use Tidal. For my taste, the “360 reality audio” does make songs sound better. The Bose are number 2, but not by much over the AirPods Pro with the Comply tips. The new ios update that added the spatial sound to the Pros with the Comply tips has made, to my ears, a huge difference. In fact, if you don’t listen to jazz, you might prefer the Pros.Microphone/Phone callsI did several blind test calls with my partner, so she could tell me which one sounded better to her. In all tests, she said my voice sounded “about 70% better” (her number) with the AirPods Pro. She said that my voice sounded “feminine” (I’m male) with the Sony/Bose compared to the AirPods Pro.I then tested the Bose and the Sonys with her as well. She said that the Bose sounded better. For the record, I did a call with my parents with the Bose, and they never complained that they couldn’t hear my voice well. They have complained several times with the Sonys (as well as other people).As for hearing phone calls, to my ears, the AirPods Pro sound more natural. I would say that the Bose are second. Phone calls are the Sony’s weakest link. If you want to use the headphones mainly for phones, as much as I love the Sony’s for music, their microphone is just not good.FitAirPods Pro - the Pros have always felt comfortable to me. However, as I mentioned previously, the Pros routinely fall off my ears. They have fallen when I’m sitting on my desk, when I’m running, walking, or riding a bike. I NEVER had this problem with the original AirPods.The Comply tips arrived yesterday. I want to take them out on a run. For being in the house this past day, they’ve been a huge improvement. I’m glad I bought them.Sony - the Sonys fit comfortably in my ear. However, they will eventually fall off. This happens if I’m walking or exercising. I have to be checking them every few minutes.Bose - I will start with the good: they stay in my ears. I’ve tried them in the house so far, but they’ve been very stable. The bad: 2 things. (1) the tip flies off my ears. The small is too small to do anything. The medium and large just end up flapping, and have to adjust it. It’s very noticeable. (2) They hurt. They stay in my ear, but the seal is seemingly so tight that it hurts my earholes (the biology term is probably the concha). I used to have the old Bose Soundsport wired headphones, and the tip in those was incredibly comfortable and stable. I might be doing something wrong when putting them in, but this will probably lead me to return them. I won’t wear headphones, especially ones at this price, that hurt.Noise Cancelling:1. Bose - they did a fantastic job with this. I stood next to the dryer, and I could barely hear it. My partner stood next to me to talk to me, and I couldn’t hear her either. If I turned it off to 0, I could hear her, but even then, the seal is so tight that it wasn’t fully perfect. On noise cancelling, these are far and away the best. If that’s the most important thing to you, stop reading the review and order them now.2. AirPods Pro - I’ve always been amazed at how good the Pros block sound for their size. I’m looking forward to trying them outside with the Complys, as I think it will be even better. However, the Bose are better.3. Sony - the Sonys block a lot of outside noise as well. I don’t know if it’s better than the Pros, but it’s right there. Hard for me to pick a number 2 here.ConclusionIt’s possible that, if the Bose didn’t hurt my ears so much, that they could be the best overall set. I don’t like how some songs sound, but in others, it’s almost as good as the Sonys, which to me, are the standard. I actually have the Bowers Wilkins PX 7s, and I prefer how music sounds on the Sonys.  However, given the pain on my ears, this is how I would rate all of them:1. Music playing - Sony, Bose, AirPods Pro.2. Phone Calls - AirPods Pro, Bose, Sony. I will note that I get complaints on voice quality when using the PX7s as well.3.  Comfort - AirPods Pro with Comply tips, Sony, Bose (VERY last).4. Noise Cancelling - Bose (by a lot), AirPods Pro, Sony.',\n",

       "  'rating': 4.0,\n",
       "  'review': '(Con)-comes with a usb c to lightning cord, but NO ADAPTER (which costs 30-50$ separately from apple) to plug into the outlet. So can only charge it with my iphone’s adapter. This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation.+. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had- no case display of battery life- BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice.-  big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable.+ quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on.+. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode. Granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything.  It would be more valuable if it was stronger.+. Siri interaction has proven positive however Alexa google et cetera are probably just as good.  So this is more of a neutral than a positive. Same with the looks of it.  Ninety percent of earbuds look good to me.- case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket+ however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket.- price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud.-  the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily.-  though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain.-  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago.+  after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds.-  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups.+. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable.+ i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by.-  I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item.

is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. angering. also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable.+ quickest instant connection to phone. all other bluetooth headphines i’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time i turn them on.+. easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the hearing enhancemebt mode. granted the hearibg enhancement is barely anything.  it would be more valuable if it was stronger.+. siri interaction has proven positive however alexa google et cetera are probably just as good.  so this is more of a neutral than a positive. same with the looks of it.  ninety percent of earbuds look good to me.- case could be flatter and more comfy in pocket+ however it is more comfy than my last earbud case and mist earbud cases arw uncomfy in pocket.- price shouldn’t be mire than 150 for what this is. i’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the cambridge 100$ ones or the sennheiser $300 ones for myself. maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because i have a positive impression of sony from previous experience. but just 100 for the cambridge with 9hr battery....or sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud.-  the fit isn’t great. those old cheap earbuds i had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. these in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily.-  though magnet case closure is nice, i will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that i can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. i currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain.-  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. switched to a key chain case two days ago.+  after these weeks of use i have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds i had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then i had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds.-  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways i use siri without any lacking, and so i do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. my friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups.+. however i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. a lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. however it does look thin and so i will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable.+ i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by.-  i’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations i had of a top line apple product. i would expect disappointments had i chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. i am considering dropping my rating to three stars as i feel like i am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. i might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  i will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on amazon, and i am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. this was my first update of my review. i might do another update should i choose to just accept and keep these appros for myself and not gift them to my sister.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700\\'s, which I\\'ve been using daily for a couple of months so I\\'ll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there\\'s nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It\\'s all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu.Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn\\'t seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don\\'t use so I didn\\'t test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else.For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won\\'t be disappointed.Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It\\'s hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they\\'re fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I\\'m not sure why they weren\\'t 100% if left in there overnight.There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can\\'t control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it\\'s okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface.There\\'s no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it\\'s been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There\\'s a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it\\'s hard to tell which mode you\\'re in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice.Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don\\'t have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I\\'ll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I\\'ve found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I\\'m guessing similar to previous AirPods.For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it\\'s just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive.For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don\\'t hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while.Would definitely recommend.',\n",

I have the first generation Apple airpods which are about 5 years old and still great and functional and now I have the Apple AirPods Pro and the quality is there as usual! Nice quality case that feels expensive and durable. I recently was gifted some Apple Beats Pro in a pretty light purple color and I have to admit reluctantly that the quality is definitely not on par with Apple's AirPods Pro! I was honestly surprised. The AirPods pro battery life is superior as well as well as the fit in ear and noise cancellation abilities. I just feel like the Beats Pro are too bulky and I'm always aware of them being in my ear; whereas, I frequently forget the AirPods and AirPods pro are even in my ear because they just almost become a part of my body when I'm wearing them. Price is great and these are the best headphones on the market right now in my opinion as far as fit, sound, noise cancellation and overall quality materials are concerned.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I want to start off by saying I am not a huge Apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.Pros:- Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building.- Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later.- Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them.- Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple.- Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that.Medicorities:- The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes.- The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.Cons:- Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan.- Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll be comparing three different pairs of headphones, as any one of them would have top marks by themselves, and my review would be meaningless; With this price point they had better be decent headphones.The headphones I\\'ll be comparing are:Apple AirPods Pro (referred to as \"Air\" from here on),Sennheiser CX 400BT (referred to as \"CX\" from here on), andSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (referred to as \"MO\" from here on).Moving on.*Sound*All 3 sound great, but the MO was the clear winner, giving the most true-to-life sound, including all of the subtle highs and lows.The Air was a not-too-far-off second; it lacked some depth in the high notes.The CX wasn’t too far behind the Air; it had better sound, however, it had significant issues stemming from noise cancellation, see below.*Noise Cancellation*The Air definitely has the best noise cancellation, for me; it isn’t especially awesome, but it’s adequate for most situations. It’s probably about as good as you can expect in this price range, but cannot compare to over-ear headphones.The MO wasn’t too terribly far behind, and may even have better noise cancellation, but due to fitment issues, below, the seal wasn’t good enough to cancel out most of the noises around me.The CX has no noise cancellation. I didn’t realize how big of an issue this would be, but when I actually manage a decent seal on the ear buds, I can hear my own breathing (not a mouth-breather, by the way!) almost as loud as my music. This was the deal-killer for me. Otherwise the CX would be on par with the others, and at half the price.*Fitment*Both of the Sennheisers fit identically, and are a better fit, in that they actually stay in my ears. However, as stated above, the actual buds don’t fit my ears; I seem to be right between the small and medium buds. The Sennheisers kind of twist into your ear, and hold similar to a sport headphone, which is nice, but also a nuisance.The Air’s buds are a much better fit, but they don’t stay in my ears at all; The slightest movement and they fall out. I bought some “ear hooks” for them, and they stay in my ears perfectly, now. However, the ear hooks add just a hair of silicone to the exterior of the headphones, which caused me discomfort after a few hours (Note: this has nothing to do with the actual headphones).*Battery*I want to say the Sennheisers’ battery lasted way longer than the Airs (a full work day). That said, I did not pay attention to how long it took them to recharge in their case. The Airs seem to only last 6-8 hours (I should mention I have long work days, haha), but I watched their battery level for a couple minutes the first time I charged them, and they were charging about 1% per 10-15 seconds. Assuming it actually keeps that pace, that’s a full charge within 16-24 minutes, which seems pretty good to me. One charge drained the Air’s case by 20%, so you get 5 charges out of it. Unfortunately, I don’t recall most of this stuff with the Sennheisers.*Technology*I’d say that none of them stand out as being better here, just different. The Sennheisers might have a slight upper hand, as they have more controls available to them, but some of them make no sense to me, and there’s no way to reprogram them (as far as I can tell. It may be possible via their app, but I imagine this is specific to the device, and I want them to work the same on all devices. Also, both Sennheisers have issues with the fact that all controls are right on the face of the headphone, and it’s almost impossible to put them in your ears without touching the face.The Airs CAN’T CONTROL VOLUME! For real?! You have to control it from your phone/listening device. This absolutely drives me nuts (at least 20 times a day). The Airs actually has a button on the stem that you have to push for all of the controls. I was under the impression it felt seamless, similar to a touchscreen; Not the case. Lastly, based on their product description and reviews, it seemed that the Airs can only connect to Apple products, but based on their incredibly short manual, it would appear that it can indeed connect to any bluetooth device (unfortunately all I own are Apple products, so I can’t verify this).All 3 headphones pause your music when you take them out, which is nice. I sure wish I could turn them off (without putting them in their case), but none of them allow this.*Summary*For myself, I opted to return the Sennheisers, and plan to stick with the Air. The Sennheisers had more significant issues involving fit and noise cancellation, and the Air has more significant issues with the interface (no volume control), and don’t stay in your ears without outside assistance via ear hooks.',\n",

       "  'review': 'As I sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of Apple’s AirPods Pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time I write a review for these bad boys, because I’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  If you’re new to the world of Apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that Apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some Apple products, like iPhones and iPods:1: Airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some Apple devices. These Airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. They come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your AirPods, and accepts the standard Lightning USB cable to charge.2: AirPods Pro, which have all of the features at the standard AirPods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “Transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: Lastly, Apple added the Airpods Max to their fleet this year. These are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the AirPods Pro, minus the charging case. You’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the AirPods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.Please note: While the cases for the AirPods and AirPods Pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. With that said, I’ve only btested the AirPods Pro with the lightning cable, as I do not own a wireless charging pad.So, Let’s Focus on the AirPods Pro Keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, I absolutely love my AirPods Pro, and I take them with me just about everywhere. I’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why I love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. If you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. With that said, the AirPods Pro are capable of being used with Apple’s “Find My” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. Keep in mind that I’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but I just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; I’d say the “FindMy” capability is more of an afterthought that Apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. But I’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. Let’s get into some facts.What’s in the box?  First of all, the packaging for the AirPods Pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as Apple has grown into the Titan of a company that it is. It’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. Inside the box, you’ll find your AirPods Pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to USB-C cable, and some documentation.Features With the price being around 80dollars more than the AirPods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the AirPods Pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.Comfort and Convenience Being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard Apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the AirPods Pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. With only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the AirPods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. The only feature that tops the comfort of the AirPods Pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. On top of these two stand-out features, Voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ TTS output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other Bluetooth headphones.Noise Cancellation and Transparency ModeLiving in the heart of the city, I constantly switch between the two modes while I travel with my cane, as I come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when I’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where I can block-out the sounds of the city while I make my way to my next crossing. And, while the noise cancellation of the AirPods Pro is incredible for their size, I do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones. And if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.On the other hand, when in transparency mode, the AirPods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. And when I say unimpeded, I mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity I haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.Sweatproof I also wear my AirPods Pro when I lift weights, and on my way both to and from my Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu gym: Two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything I’ve subjected them to. It’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. I haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and Apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the AirPods resiliency.Battery life and Charging case While I haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article I found stated that the standard AirPods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the AirPos Pro will survive for 5.5 hours. Do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.Alright, but how do they sound? My AirPods Pro deliver a surprising level of sound quality, whether I’m listening to audiobooks, podcasts, or music. They are undeniably the best pair of earbuds I’ve ever owned, and I’ve had a hard time transitioning back to standard Bluetooth earbuds at times when my Airpods Pro are charging. Spoken-word content sounds crisp and professional, with no fuzziness looming around the speaker’s voice, so I’m not often distracted by poor audio quality, unless I have an unstable wi-fi connection. And, the AirPods Pro even add an extra layer of depth to stories that have occasional music or sound effects entwined throughout their duration. Finally, when listening to music, the AirPods Pro have a surprising amount of power; I haven’t had the feeling that I’m missing any part of a song because of their bass output when in noise cancellation mode. However, When in noisier settings with other music in the background, like at a public gym, I do find myself longing for my aforementioned, over-the-ear  Bose headphones, because I can hear too much of the gym’s music over my own.Wrapping Up If you know you want to buy a pair of wireless earbuds, I can’t recommend the AirPods Pro enough. While I do believe they are a tad pricey, inflated prices come with the territory when it comes to Apple products, and I feel like I’ve gotten my moneys worth from these earbuds. With that said, if you’ve decided it’s time to track-down a pair for yourself, I suggest shopping around. While prices fluctuate everywhere, several articles I’ve skimmed mentioned that Amazon occasionally offers much-better AirPods and AirPods Pro deals than Apple.',\n",
       "  'lower_summary': 'as i sat on my computer today, perusing options to buy another set of apple’s airpods pro, it dawned on me: it’s about time i write a review for these bad boys, because i’ve used mine almost daily for the past year-and-a-half.  if you’re new to the world of apple’s headphones and earbuds, you may not realize that apple offers three options that will suit your needs much better than the standard, wired ear buds that come with some apple products, like iphones and ipods:1: airpods, which are the wireless companion to the standard earbuds the you’ll find accompanying some apple devices. these airpods are the size of the standard earbuds, if you were to cut the cords off at the very base of the earbud stems. they come in a small, square-shaped charging case with round corners, which serves as a convenient storage location for your airpods, and accepts the standard lightning usb cable to charge.2: airpods pro, which have all of the features at the standard airpods, plus a more comfortable fit, better sound quality, and two modes of sound augmentation, being a noise-canceling mode and a “transparency mode”, which allows you to listen to your surroundings while you listen to your music, podcasts, or other media.3: lastly, apple added the airpods max to their fleet this year. these are over-the-ear headphones that offer similar features to the airpods pro, minus the charging case. you’ll find that these headphones have better noise-cancelation and sound quality than the airpods at the cost of a larger profile and price tag.please note: while the cases for the airpods and airpods pro accept the lightning cable to charge, they can also be placed on a mag-safe charging pad to charge. with that said, i’ve only btested the airpods pro with the lightning cable, as i do not own a wireless charging pad.so, let’s focus on the airpods pro keeping in mind that this post has no ties to any outside entity, so my opinions aren’t being skewed with the intent of pleasing an advertiser, i absolutely love my airpods pro, and i take them with me just about everywhere. i’m on my second pair, because they are easy to lose due to their compact case, but that small profile is also a big part of why i love these earbuds, so it’s a bit of a paradox. if you can see, this won’t be much of a problem for you, but if you’re visually-impaired, it’s another story. with that said, the airpods pro are capable of being used with apple’s “find my” app, but you have to be pretty close to the case for this feature to be beneficial if you have a visual impairment. keep in mind that i’m also deaf in one ear, so your mileage may vary here, but i just don’t think the sound is strong enough to truly tout this as an outstanding feature; i’d say the “findmy” capability is more of an afterthought that apple added to increase the length of the “features” list for these earbuds. but i’ll save the rest of my opinions until the wrap-up at the bottom of this post. let’s get into some facts.what’s in the box?  first of all, the packaging for the airpods pro lives up to the standard we’ve come to know as apple has grown into the titan of a company that it is. it’s sleek, compact, and satisfying to open. inside the box, you’ll find your airpods pro and accompanying charging case, three different sizes of the silicone tips that form the seal necessary for effective noise cancellation, one lightning to usb-c cable, and some documentation.features with the price being around 80dollars more than the airpods with charging case, it’s a no-brainer  that the airpods pro are the better choice, whether you’re in need of noise cancellation or you just have an extra 80 bucks burning a hole in your pocket, and you’re about to see why.comfort and convenience being someone who owns a pair of ears that don’t cooperate with standard apple earbuds very well, the comfort and secure fit provided by the silicone tips of the airpods pro are almost at the top of my list when it comes to benefits of these earbuds. with only three size choices, you may feel that two different sizes provide the same level of comfort and sound quality, but the airpods run a “fit test” during setup to determine which of the tips are the perfect fit for you. the only feature that tops the comfort of the airpods pro is their ability to seamlessly alternate between the noise cancellation and transparency modes. on top of these two stand-out features, voiceover users won’t notice any latency between executing gestures on-screen and their devices’ tts output, which is a somewhat common occurrence with other bluetooth headphones.noise cancellation and transparency modeliving in the heart of the city, i constantly switch between the two modes while i travel with my cane, as i come to street crossings and need to hear traffic, or when i’m on long spans of uninterrupted sidewalk, where i can block-out the sounds of the city while i make my way to my next crossing. and, while the noise cancellation of the airpods pro is incredible for their size, i do want to note that they don’t provide as much soundproofing as an over-the-ear headphone, like the bose noise cancelling 700 headphones. and if you’re curious, you can find my review of those headphones here.on the other hand, when in transparency mode, the airpods utilize both their inward and outward-facing microphones to bypass the sound-masking that comes with having standard earbuds in your ears, leaving ones’ ability to hear their surroundings unimpeded. and when i say unimpeded, i mean it; when it comes to listening to my surroundings, the transparency mode provides a level of clarity i haven’t experienced with another pair of earbuds- and especially not with over-the-ear headphones.sweatproof i also wear my airpods pro when i lift weights, and on my way both to and from my brazilian jiu-jitsu gym: two times when there is a lot of sweat and a lot of movement, and so far, their sweat/splashproof design has withstood everything i’ve subjected them to. it’s not uncommon for me to wash them under a faucet, and again, they still work just fine. i haven’t submerged them into a vessel of water though, and apple has outlined that this would surpass the limits of the airpods resiliency.battery life and charging case while i haven’t been able to find any specific details as to the battery life of the charging case itself, one comparison article i found stated that the standard airpods can be used for 4.5 hours before needing to be charged by their case, while the airpos pro will survive for 5.5 hours. do keep in mind that these measurement are approximate, as the battery life may vary greatly, depending on distance from the connected device, volume level, mode, and many other factors.alright, but how do they sound?

       "  'review': 'I\\'m about two weeks into my new Airpods Pro and it\\'s time to drop some comments.  For context I\\'m coming from a $30 pair of Anker (wired) Bluetooth headphones that have served me well for 5+ years (and still work by the way), and Bose QC35 II headphones.  I\\'ve also spent an interesting amount of time with Bose QC30 headphones which would be more physically on par with the Airpods Pro.== Noise Cancellation==Noise cancellation in true wireless format  are the only reasons I was willing to chunk down $250 (an outrageous price even by Bose standards) for a pair of headphones.  I wanted something I could wear at the gym or on travel.  Note for those of you who don\\'t get the \"true wireless\" marketing term (I didn\\'t and had to look it up), it simply means Bluetooth headphones that don\\'t  have a wire between the two ear buds.Unsurprisingly my QC 35 IIs still outperform Airpods Pro *but* my QC35s have huge physical ear pieces to block out more sound so this isn\\'t entirely fair.  The QC30s are more of an earbud style and compared to Airpods Pro I\\'d say the two are on par when it comes to noise cancellation.  Maybe a slight edge to the QC30s.Where my Bose headphones shine is they switch between noise cancelling and no noise cancelling flawlessly, over and over.  My Airpods behave erratically switching between modes even once.  When switching between noise cancellation and transparent modes I\\'ve had the Airpods become unresponsive to click commands, lose connection in one ear, had the ear buds get out of sync, had noise cancellation in one ear and not the other, and a host of other issues.  I usually have to put the buds back in the case and let them sit for a minute or two to reset them.== Sound Quality ==We buy ear buds to listen to stuff.  I listen to audio books, and am a Spotify junkie!  Also serving the occasional phone call.  I like a wide spread of music but mainly hang in the trance, electronica, rock, and metal categories.  The sound stage (that is, separation of instruments - making it so each instrument has a distinct position in your perceived space) is excellent!  Again not quite as good as my QC35s but darn close.  My Anker headphones don\\'t even compete.I think most electronica and low end bass lovers will be disappointed with the Airpods.  Being physically small makes it hard to do huge bass as it is, and I feel the EQ (not adjustable outside of Spotify) is tuned to focus more on the mid and high range.  Regardless, I was pretty disappointed at first, but I\\'ve adjusted a bit and am happy enough with the bass end now.  Mid and high range are superb!  I generally used a Rock EQ profile in Spotify\\'s settings with my Anker buds and Bose headsets.  I decided the \"Flat\" setting is better with my Airpods.  I will say that the bass end is very distinct on Airpods (like you can actually pick out the bass guitar!) and that crisp stage separation may be what ruins the generally smeared bass end of a lot of electronica aside from less physical thump.Audio books are not a problem at all, and so far phone calls seems good too.== Form Factor ==Excellent!  Very comfortable, fit snugly, and I have yet to even  have an ear bud budget while running, cycling, rowing, etc. These buds are really light and it\\'s easy to forget they\\'re in you ears!  So tiny they\\'re a little hard to deal with getting them in and out of their case.Apple provides three sizes of earpiece.  They are made of soft comfortable material.  I found I needed the large size.  Getting the ear piece off can be a little tricky - they snap on like little Lego bricks, and you have to pull on them until they pop off.  I was afraid i was going to tear them trying to get them off, but they seem to be pretty durable.  Be advised that there is a \"check fit\" option on your iPhone to help you find the right size.  Got into Bluetooth settings, and click the info button next to your Airpods to get to the Airpod settings.== Battery Life ==I don\\'t have these in all day but I\\'d say the specs Apple provides are pretty close.  Maybe a little low.  I\\'ve gone 3-4 hours at a time without running out of juice. I usually listen at mid level volumes so if you crank it you may have a different experience.== Connectivity ==CRAZY CRAZY CRAZY amazing!  Being an Apple product these paired up with my iPhone just by opening the case and holding my phone near.  That\\'s not the amazing part.  The amazing part is the range!  My Anker buds dropped out a lot at the gym if I was doing an exercise where my body effectively wrapped my phone and blocked the signal.  I could get maybe 30-40 feet if I had a clear line of site.  I forgot my phone in a stretching area and started a walk around an indoor track.  I must\\'ve made it 100 feet through walls, people, and gym equipment before my Airpods dropped out even a little.  I know a lot of this is Bluetooth 5 and not entirely unique to Airpods but I have to say I\\'m impressed!== Surprise Feature ==I wasn\\'t particularly interested in more than the noise cancellation and small form factor.  Sound quality is important to me but not the main driver here.  While the spec sheet calls it out (and it wasn\\'t really a surprise) I am extremely surprised by how much I like the in-ear detection feature.  It\\'s really nice to be able to pop out a bud, have your music pause and have a conversation then put the bud back in and pick up again.  Pretty slick!  Also imperative since turning noise cancellation on and off causes problems and you have to take a bud out to talk.== Other Buggy Stuff ==Apart from the things I\\'ve listed in the Noise Cancellation section, I\\'ve had a lot of other weird behavior.  Once I pulled the buds right out of the case and put them in my ears and  had one bud fail to connect.  Sometimes if I  put the buds in the case with noise cancellation on and then put the buds back in later they will come on without noise cancellation and won\\'t let me switch noise cancellation back on (through any method including settings on my iPhone).This is incredibly disappointing at this price tag let alone for an Apple product.  Bose charges the same money but they are rock solid when it comes to the prime use cases.  In general I feel like Apple\\'s quality continues to degrade with every release.  I get bugs are part of software (it\\'s what I do for a living) but you don\\'t release a product with major and obvious bugs in the primary use case of the product.  Especially at this price point!  My Anker buds were $30, have lasted me years, and have worked flawlessly.  Yea they\\'re simpler functionality, but still.== Bottom Line ==In the hopes of a software update to fix all the weird issues, I am overall a fan and very pleased!  The noise cancellation, sound quality, and battery life are not state of the art, but come together in a perfect form factor and make it happen for me.  I dinged a star for sound quality (need a little more bass end), and the general buggy state of the product.  My only other wish is these were in the $150 range.  That $250 is really hard to swallow, especially when things don\\'t work flawlessly.  But I expect to be gouged by Apple so I go in knowing you\\'re going to over pay on the expectation you\\'re going to get a flawless top quality product.  Didn\\'t quite pan out this go.  Software updates may change that.',\n",

       "  'review': 'I bought the AirPods Pro when they came out. I had the first AirPods which, although didn’t sound great, where easy to use and carry, and I thought had a great microphone. Although the Pros are much better, I’ve always had a problem with them: they fall of my ears. I just got the new Comply 2.0 tips for them yesterday, which prompted me to write this review. By the way, so far, the tips are great. The Pros sound better, and have stayed in my ears.I also have the Sony WF 1000XM3, which, as much as I like them, also fall off my ears.The “ear falling” problem led me to try the Bose.Sound:I tried a number of songs on all 3. I streamed the music from Tidal Hi Fi, so they’re all at higher resolutions.  I’ll list some here:1. Are you even real? James Blake - this song sounded terrible on the Bose. Muffled to the point that I wonder if these headphones are working correctly. As you might have read, the Bose Music app doesn’t have an equalizer, so there’s nothing you can do on this one. On the AirPods Pro, the song sounded much better than in the Bose. On the Sonys, about 3% better than in the Pros.2. Blinding Lights - The Weekend - This song came out great in all 3. Edge to Sony over the Bose, but not by much. It sounded tiniest on the Pros.3. Morning Dance - Spyro Gyra. This is a classic smooth jazz song. The Bose won this round. The song was expansive, lots of small details came out, it was great. I also played a couple of Joshua Redman songs, and I would say the Bose sounded better on those.  I feel that the Bose will probably play better jazz music, if that’s your thing.4. Malamente - Rosalia. The Sonys won this round going away. Once again, the Bose sounded a bit muffled. Song was good on the Pros, but perhaps a little bit too trebly.5. Paranoid Android - Radiohead. This song was really good on all 3, Bose was not that far off the Sonys.6. The Only Thing - Travis. This was another song that the Bose couldn’t play well either. Once again the tinny, muffled sound came up. It felt like i turned the music down on the headphones (I didn’t). Definitely better on the Sony and Pros.Overall, on music playing, I would rate the Sonys number 1, especially if you use Tidal. For my taste, the “360 reality audio” does make songs sound better. The Bose are number 2, but not by much over the AirPods Pro with the Comply tips. The new ios update that added the spatial sound to the Pros with the Comply tips has made, to my ears, a huge difference. In fact, if you don’t listen to jazz, you might prefer the Pros.Microphone/Phone callsI did several blind test calls with my partner, so she could tell me which one sounded better to her. In all tests, she said my voice sounded “about 70% better” (her number) with the AirPods Pro. She said that my voice sounded “feminine” (I’m male) with the Sony/Bose compared to the AirPods Pro.I then tested the Bose and the Sonys with her as well. She said that the Bose sounded better. For the record, I did a call with my parents with the Bose, and they never complained that they couldn’t hear my voice well. They have complained several times with the Sonys (as well as other people).As for hearing phone calls, to my ears, the AirPods Pro sound more natural. I would say that the Bose are second. Phone calls are the Sony’s weakest link. If you want to use the headphones mainly for phones, as much as I love the Sony’s for music, their microphone is just not good.FitAirPods Pro - the Pros have always felt comfortable to me. However, as I mentioned previously, the Pros routinely fall off my ears. They have fallen when I’m sitting on my desk, when I’m running, walking, or riding a bike. I NEVER had this problem with the original AirPods.The Comply tips arrived yesterday. I want to take them out on a run. For being in the house this past day, they’ve been a huge improvement. I’m glad I bought them.Sony - the Sonys fit comfortably in my ear. However, they will eventually fall off. This happens if I’m walking or exercising. I have to be checking them every few minutes.Bose - I will start with the good: they stay in my ears. I’ve tried them in the house so far, but they’ve been very stable. The bad: 2 things. (1) the tip flies off my ears. The small is too small to do anything. The medium and large just end up flapping, and have to adjust it. It’s very noticeable. (2) They hurt. They stay in my ear, but the seal is seemingly so tight that it hurts my earholes (the biology term is probably the concha). I used to have the old Bose Soundsport wired headphones, and the tip in those was incredibly comfortable and stable. I might be doing something wrong when putting them in, but this will probably lead me to return them. I won’t wear headphones, especially ones at this price, that hurt.Noise Cancelling:1. Bose - they did a fantastic job with this. I stood next to the dryer, and I could barely hear it. My partner stood next to me to talk to me, and I couldn’t hear her either. If I turned it off to 0, I could hear her, but even then, the seal is so tight that it wasn’t fully perfect. On noise cancelling, these are far and away the best. If that’s the most important thing to you, stop reading the review and order them now.2. AirPods Pro - I’ve always been amazed at how good the Pros block sound for their size. I’m looking forward to trying them outside with the Complys, as I think it will be even better. However, the Bose are better.3. Sony - the Sonys block a lot of outside noise as well. I don’t know if it’s better than the Pros, but it’s right there. Hard for me to pick a number 2 here.ConclusionIt’s possible that, if the Bose didn’t hurt my ears so much, that they could be the best overall set. I don’t like how some songs sound, but in others, it’s almost as good as the Sonys, which to me, are the standard. I actually have the Bowers Wilkins PX 7s, and I prefer how music sounds on the Sonys.  However, given the pain on my ears, this is how I would rate all of them:1. Music playing - Sony, Bose, AirPods Pro.2. Phone Calls - AirPods Pro, Bose, Sony. I will note that I get complaints on voice quality when using the PX7s as well.3.  Comfort - AirPods Pro with Comply tips, Sony, Bose (VERY last).4. Noise Cancelling - Bose (by a lot), AirPods Pro, Sony.',\n",

The noise cancellation is fantastic and I've been able to tune out super loud noises at work or in transit. The sound quality for songs and audiobooks/podcasts has never failed me and they're comfortable enough to forget that you're wearing them. I was worried about them falling out but they do a great job of staying in your ears. I've only found an issue if a big chunk of my hair brushes them that they might come loose but otherwise I've rarely ever had them come out on their own. They last their told 4 hours or so and the case continues to charge them for longer. I wear them all day. Calls work well too on android and they even reduce background noise.

       "  'review': '(Con)-comes with a usb c to lightning cord, but NO ADAPTER (which costs 30-50$ separately from apple) to plug into the outlet. So can only charge it with my iphone’s adapter. This cord it came with is useless to me since I have no macbook, but if you have a macbook u will see this cord as a positive+ noise cancelation is pretty good sometimes. Drowned out vending machines, but not the fan-system at my job for some reason. So at least I can use them in the lunchroom, but not where I actually needed noise cancelation.+. Case is more comfortable than the last earbuds case i had- no case display of battery life- BIG negative is only 4 hr battery life while other earbuds are hitting eight and even eleven hours. There is no idle mode so as long as airpod pros are out of case they are losing a ot of juice.-  big negative for me, as I wanted to fall asleep with these on ; is that when the battery dies four hours into my sleep a very loud battery dead symbol sounds waking me up. Angering. Also my plan to wear one all day at work is now undoable.+ quickest instant connection to phone. All other bluetooth headphines I’ve used have not connected quite so instantly every time I turn them on.+. Easy transition between canceling tansparent mode and the Hearing enhancemebt mode.

I’m thinking of gifting this to my sister, and buying the Cambridge 100$ ones or the Sennheiser $300 ones for myself. Maybe even thise 200$ sony ones because I have a positive impression of Sony from previous experience. But just 100 for the Cambridge with 9hr battery....or Sennheiser being the highest quality sound in an earbud.-  the fit isn’t great. Those old cheap earbuds I had made a more snug noise isolating/reducing fit. These in the size my iphone test told me is best keep coming slightly unplugged so outaide sounds can get in easily.-  though magnet case closure is nice, I will have to buy a button clasping cover for the case so that I can carry them on my keychains. 99% of the cover cases on amazon rely solely on the charge case’s magnetism to keep it closed, and my airpods have flown out more than once upon brushing up against things. I currently have a rubber band around the silicone cover case on my charge case on my key chain.-  i have found it after weeks of use, to be overall uncomfortable in my jeans’ pockets. Switched to a key chain case two days ago.+  after these weeks of use I have found the ios instantly putting a single headphone into mono mode (when wearing just one) to be time saving as with my non apple buds I had to go to settings search mono and activate mono every time i wanted to use one bud only, and then I had to repeat the process when i wanted to do both buds.-  i have seen my friend using samsung’s bugsby in the same ways I use siri without any lacking, and so I do not see the advantage of siri over bugsby alexis or cortana. My friend paid sixty dollars for a pair of earbuds and which have given him just as much satisfaction with less of the hiccups.+. However i will point out that this airpod pro charge case seems more durable than my friend’s case as his hinges on his case already broke. A lot of the cheaper buds appear to have weaker hinges in the cases conpared to my airpodpro case. However it does look thin and so I will be cautious with my hinges just in case it isn’t actually more durable.+ i have rather enjoyed sitting outside with the transparency mode and hearing mode both activated as it creates an enjoyable effect in listening to the birds, wind, and cars passing by.-  I’m throwing in one more negative because of my overall feel of the price compared to what one would expect compared to all the options out there and also compared to the high expectations I had of a top line apple product. I would expect disappointments had I chosen the cheaper basic airpods, but the pro version of an apple product should’ve proven exemplary. I am considering dropping my rating to three stars as I feel like I am using an experimental prototype that was just thrown out here for beta testing of a sort. I might gift these to a relative and just get myself some cheaper ones like what my friend has since their sound quality seems to be just as good if not better, their battery life is literally twice as long, and their case is half the size.  I will not mention the name brand of his as there are plenty out there on Amazon, and I am just trying to give a complete and honest review; not trying to plug some other item. This was my first update of my review. I might do another update should I choose to just accept and keep these apPros for myself and not gift them to my sister.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Received my AirPods Pro a couple of days ago and have been using them day and night since. I also have the new Bose 700\\'s, which I\\'ve been using daily for a couple of months so I\\'ll compare to them.I commute each day on a noisy city bus. Sometimes there are people talking and sometimes there\\'s nothing but the loud noises of the bus. The Bose headphones are not sweat or weatherproof, and so are not useful outside unless the skies are clear. With winter coming, the Bose also prevent wearing a winter hat, so I decided to buy the Air Pods for use in commuting and then use the Bose once I get to my desk at work.I have never owned AirPods before. A friend at work has regular AirPods (not Pro), and the photo attached to my review shows the difference in size. These were easy to set up -- you just hold your unlocked iPhone a couple inches away from the AirPods in their charging case (with the case open). It\\'s all seamless. They automatically showed up in my Macbook bluetooth menu once connected with the iPhone, so all I had to do was click \"connect\" in the bluetooth menu.Interestingly, the play/pause squeeze of the stem doesn\\'t seem to work for controlling the laptop -- maybe it only works for Apple Music, which I don\\'t use so I didn\\'t test. And the other thing different -- and worse -- than the Bose is that if I pause on the laptop and then play again on the phone, the AirPods are not automatically connected and the music came out of the phone directly. The Bose connects to two devices at once so it will play whichever one is playing sounds (which can be annoying if the phone is playing and the computer gives a notification sound or vice versa). But in order to play again on the phone, I had to go into the phone Bluetooth menu and reconnect (not re-pair, just reconnect). So my conclusion is you have to manually reconnect for device switching. You get a little alert sound when connected -- no voice, no battery status, no \"connected to xxx\" like the Bose does -- nothing else.For music quality, the Bose quality is a fair amount better -- which would be expected since they are full size over the ear headphones. The AirPods Pro are still very good though, and unless you are an audiophile, you won\\'t be disappointed.Charging the AirPods case uses a standard iPhone/iPad lightning charger. It comes with a cable that will connect to a later model Macbook USB C port -- so USB C to lightning. If you want to use an outlet, you will need to have an existing lightning charger, which most of us have plenty of anyway. It\\'s hard to tell when the case is completely charged. The orange light comes on but goes off after just a few seconds, instead of just staying on and changing to green once they\\'re fully charged. The first night I got them, I charged them in the case overnight before using them. When I connected them, they said the AirPods were only 58% charged, so I\\'m not sure why they weren\\'t 100% if left in there overnight.There is a nice new longpress feature on the volume of the iPhone that appears when the AirPods are connected to the iPhone. You can control the volume (you can\\'t control the volume right on the AirPods, which is a slight bummer but it\\'s okay) and noise cancelling from this new interface.There\\'s no tapping on these AirPods -- you slightly squeeze the little stem. There is a soft click when it registers, almost like pressing a touch pad. It took a few seconds to figure out how to do it, but it\\'s been fine since. A longer squeeze toggles between the noise cancellation modes. There\\'s a slightly different sound for going into transparency mode and going into noise cancellation mode, but in a quiet room it\\'s hard to tell which mode you\\'re in, as opposed to the Bose, which literally tells you in a voice.Transparency mode uses microphones to let in the sound around you, so that you can keep them in while still talking to people. This is how they differ from noise isolating earbuds, which block your ear from hearing anything but don\\'t have active noise canceling. These have noise canceling I\\'ll talk about in a minute. But there is also an \"off\" mode available only (that I\\'ve found) through the volume long press described above. These just put them in basic noise isolation mode -- I\\'m guessing similar to previous AirPods.For noise cancellation, they are surprisingly very effective. More effective than I thought they would be. They are best at blocking out white noise -- bus engines, office sounds, fans, etc. They are good at voices if it\\'s just people talking in a group at a normal volume. But when I walked through the busy office cafeteria at lunch time, they did not do as good of a job as the Bose at blocking out the loud talking and other uneven cafeteria noises. Interestingly, they do a great job at blocking one-off noises like a door slamming or someone dropping something. The Bose have a hard time with sounds like that for some reason. I would say they are 80-90% as effective as the full size over ear Bose overall, which is very impressive.For comfort, obviously the Bose are better (and sound better) for hours of desk usage, and also given that the battery on the Bose is about 19 hours and these are about 4, the Bose will be what I use all day at my desk. But for moving around, walking the dogs, commuting, and portability, the AirPods are terrific and don\\'t hurt at all or cause my ears to sweat like the Bose do after a while.Would definitely recommend.',\n",

I have the first generation Apple airpods which are about 5 years old and still great and functional and now I have the Apple AirPods Pro and the quality is there as usual! Nice quality case that feels expensive and durable. I recently was gifted some Apple Beats Pro in a pretty light purple color and I have to admit reluctantly that the quality is definitely not on par with Apple's AirPods Pro! I was honestly surprised. The AirPods pro battery life is superior as well as well as the fit in ear and noise cancellation abilities. I just feel like the Beats Pro are too bulky and I'm always aware of them being in my ear; whereas, I frequently forget the AirPods and AirPods pro are even in my ear because they just almost become a part of my body when I'm wearing them. Price is great and these are the best headphones on the market right now in my opinion as far as fit, sound, noise cancellation and overall quality materials are concerned.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"I want to start off by saying I am not a huge Apple person which this product is mostly aimed towards. I have a mix of products with different operating systems; I have a Google Pixel phone, an iPad, and a Windows PC. These earbuds luckily work with all of these products pretty flawlessly with occasional hiccups on Windows, though of course they work the best with my iPad. I got these on sale for $170 because personally the $250 price tag was just too much for me, and at this price they are a steal. I would say if you can get these for $200 or lower they are well worth the cost.Pros:- Sound. Sound quality is really good for most music. I'm a bit of a bass head so I don't get the fullest experience I would like out of these, but I still enjoy the clarity of the music. I did not get these specifically for bass, as I knew they would not be bass-heavy, which is why this is still a pro for me. If you listen to lots of hip hop or indie music these sound great.- Features. The ANC on these is not the best, but you should not expect the best from little earbuds at this cost. These block out my loud air conditioner and a lot of other white noise with a consistent sound wave. These do not block out loud sudden noises like typing or people conversing, though they do a good job quieting things down through noise isolation from a good seal. Transparency mode on these is amazing as well; with them on, it really sounds like there is nothing in your ears (except your own voice will sound slightly muffled to you). I am continuously amazed by how well transparency mode works and I can see the use cases for them only building.- Comfort. Honestly, with the relief of pressure Apple put into these with the little vents on the bottom of the AirPods, I forget these are in my ears. They are so comfortable to wear, which says a lot for someone with small, sensitive ears. This may differ if these don't fit your ears properly, which I will mention later.- Portability. The charging case is nice and compact, and even with a silicone case on top of it I can easily slip them in small pockets of bags and in large pockets. The AirPods themselves are quite small and I can see someone misplacing them if they lay them down somewhere and forget about them, but they're bigger than a lot of other TWS earbuds I've owned so hopefully I will be able to keep track of them.- Seamlessness with Apple products. AirPods are, of course, Apple made. Therefore they are designed to work with iPhones, iPads, Macs, and Macbooks. These pause and play instantaneously with my iPad and I can access all the special features you get specific to Apple.- Presentation. Apple wins on sleekness. Not much else to say about that.Medicorities:- The fit of these is pretty good for the average ear, but if you have smaller ear canals like me they can be just a little troublesome. My left ear canal is almost too small for the smallest tip of these, but with maneuvering I can still get a good seal. They fall out if I lay on my arm in bed, but other than that they stay in. Definitely try all the earbud sizes.- The magnet for the lid of the case is pretty sturdy though not super strong, so I find it sometimes opens when I carry them around. This doesn't happen too often but be aware of that.Cons:- Price. As I stated before I don't think these are worth $250. I think $200 is just right for them, and the extra $50 is simply paying for the Apple branding. This is why I'm not a huge Apple fan.- Not seamless with non-Apple products. If you only use Apple, these will work great for you so disregard this point. I didn't expect these to work with everything, though an Android app would be nice. If Samsung can make an app for their Galaxy Buds for iOS devices, I think Apple can do the same for Android. I have connection issues on occasion with my Windows PC, and taking out and AirPod does not in any way auto-pause/play on Windows nor Android. All stem pressing functions do work as they are supposed to though. This is a mix between a mediocre feature and a con for me.Tl;dr I think that the pros outweigh the cons for the AirPods Pros, and I recommend them for anyone looking for great sound with any device. Apple could be a little more friendly to those who don't buy everything Apple, but from a competitive standpoint I get it. I can see myself using these on a daily basis and I think they are a great buy if you can get them under $200.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'I\\'ll be comparing three different pairs of headphones, as any one of them would have top marks by themselves, and my review would be meaningless; With this price point they had better be decent headphones.The headphones I\\'ll be comparing are:Apple AirPods Pro (referred to as \"Air\" from here on),Sennheiser CX 400BT (referred to as \"CX\" from here on), andSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2 (referred to as \"MO\" from here on).Moving on.*Sound*All 3 sound great, but the MO was the clear winner, giving the most true-to-life sound, including all of the subtle highs and lows.The Air was a not-too-far-off second; it lacked some depth in the high notes.The CX wasn’t too far behind the Air; it had better sound, however, it had significant issues stemming from noise cancellation, see below.*Noise Cancellation*The Air definitely has the best noise cancellation, for me; it isn’t especially awesome, but it’s adequate for most situations. It’s probably about as good as you can expect in this price range, but cannot compare to over-ear headphones.The MO wasn’t too terribly far behind, and may even have better noise cancellation, but due to fitment issues, below, the seal wasn’t good enough to cancel out most of the noises around me.The CX has no noise cancellation. I didn’t realize how big of an issue this would be, but when I actually manage a decent seal on the ear buds, I can hear my own breathing (not a mouth-breather, by the way!) almost as loud as my music. This was the deal-killer for me. Otherwise the CX would be on par with the others, and at half the price.*Fitment*Both of the Sennheisers fit identically, and are a better fit, in that they actually stay in my ears. However, as stated above, the actual buds don’t fit my ears; I seem to be right between the small and medium buds. The Sennheisers kind of twist into your ear, and hold similar to a sport headphone, which is nice, but also a nuisance.The Air’s buds are a much better fit, but they don’t stay in my ears at all; The slightest movement and they fall out. I bought some “ear hooks” for them, and they stay in my ears perfectly, now. However, the ear hooks add just a hair of silicone to the exterior of the headphones, which caused me discomfort after a few hours (Note: this has nothing to do with the actual headphones).*Battery*I want to say the Sennheisers’ battery lasted way longer than the Airs (a full work day). That said, I did not pay attention to how long it took them to recharge in their case. The Airs seem to only last 6-8 hours (I should mention I have long work days, haha), but I watched their battery level for a couple minutes the first time I charged them, and they were charging about 1% per 10-15 seconds. Assuming it actually keeps that pace, that’s a full charge within 16-24 minutes, which seems pretty good to me. One charge drained the Air’s case by 20%, so you get 5 charges out of it. Unfortunately, I don’t recall most of this stuff with the Sennheisers.*Technology*I’d say that none of them stand out as being better here, just different. The Sennheisers might have a slight upper hand, as they have more controls available to them, but some of them make no sense to me, and there’s no way to reprogram them (as far as I can tell. It may be possible via their app, but I imagine this is specific to the device, and I want them to work the same on all devices. Also, both Sennheisers have issues with the fact that all controls are right on the face of the headphone, and it’s almost impossible to put them in your ears without touching the face.The Airs CAN’T CONTROL VOLUME! For real?! You have to control it from your phone/listening device. This absolutely drives me nuts (at least 20 times a day). The Airs actually has a button on the stem that you have to push for all of the controls. I was under the impression it felt seamless, similar to a touchscreen; Not the case. Lastly, based on their product description and reviews, it seemed that the Airs can only connect to Apple products, but based on their incredibly short manual, it would appear that it can indeed connect to any bluetooth device (unfortunately all I own are Apple products, so I can’t verify this).All 3 headphones pause your music when you take them out, which is nice. I sure wish I could turn them off (without putting them in their case), but none of them allow this.*Summary*For myself, I opted to return the Sennheisers, and plan to stick with the Air. The Sennheisers had more significant issues involving fit and noise cancellation, and the Air has more significant issues with the interface (no volume control), and don’t stay in your ears without outside assistance via ear hooks.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The Skull Candy Crusher Wireless is a great set of cans for multiple uses. Let me say, first, we have bought 3 pairs of these in less than a year. First pair was for our 15 yo son, second pair was for my husband, and the third pair I finally bought for myself (early Xmas gift). The fact we have 3 pairs of these should say it all! All 3 pairs we bought are in black. Too many reviews had the white pair breaking, so with this last purchase, I felt there were not enough reviews with enough time on them for the new colors to make me feel confident they, too, would not break in the same spot as the white ones. So, black it was. One can never go wrong with black in headphones!The first pair was bought in early May, for a 15 yo who is not always super careful with his stuff. They\\'ve been dropped, and used every single day by him and are still working perfectly, still charge just as fast and the battery still lasts forever. They have held up to his clumsiness and look as if we bought them yesterday, though they\\'ve been dropped and dinged here and there. My husband got his the 3rd week in May and he uses his constantly. He works from home and is on the phone a LOT. Conference calls, broadcasts (radio/YouTube for interviews), and phone calls/video calls with friends both here in the States and globally. As for my husband\\'s use - they DO work with Skype on a cell - we have Note 9s, and they DO work with Skype via the computer (for reference, he has an Asus Rog). He had to go into Skype and tell it to recognize these particular cans. They didn\\'t work at first, but he did finally get them to. They work on all of our other call apps, WhatsApp, Wire, Signal, VSee Etc. They work with our regular phone calls beautifully too. They also connect to our Bluetooth unit we have hooked into our TV. They both connect even though we have the same headphones. We had some trouble getting 2 identical headphones connecting at first. One would automatically pick up, then we had to activate pairing mode on the headphones then press our bluetooth button on the tv unit and then it found them. Took a day to figure it out, but we did it lol! They work AWESOME with that! If you turn the bass all the way up or 3/4 of the way up, I swear, it seriously feels like you are sitting in a movie theater. The sound quality is awesome for watching tv. Often, one of us will fall asleep and to avoid waking the other, tv gets muted and headphones go on. Now, we use them even when we are both awake because they make for a great experience with the upgraded sound for the tv! Our son just keeps them connected to his phone or he uses the auxiliary cord and plugs them into his switch when he plays it. Sure beats ear buds. Plus, our son says earbuds are super uncomfortable for him and refuses to use them, so that\\'s why we initially bought these for him.The battery life is CRAZY GOOD! This is one of the reasons we went with these 3 times. They charge up from fully drained fairly quick (a few hours) and the battery lasts FOREVER. This battery, by far, is the best out there. Nothing else to say - battery life is AMAZING.Side note - they sound even better when you go in to your cell and tweak the audio settings to your liking. On our Notes, we both had to download a good EQ/audio app and we tweaked from there. He did the same thing on his laptop, and again, amazing sound. Hes a bit of an audiophile, and while no - these aren\\'t the top cans for an audiophile, but he is very impressed with the sound (music/tv) for the price. He actually loves these and prefers these cans for calls, watching TV, and listening to music over his top dollar Sony Noise Cancelling headphones and over his even higher priced Sennheisers. He got these because he needed a good pair with a good mic and sound for calls (as people were complaining over hearing him with the Sonys), and true cans for audiophiles, well, you can\\'t really use them for phone calls lol. He has an expensive pair of Sennheiser cans, and once tweaked, honestly, these sounded better to me than the $400 ones. But - my ears are super sensitive to treble and it hurts my ears. So the highs not being very pronounced with these is perfect for me. The mids are definitely recognizable and neither of us have any issue with sound nor do we miss anything. When watching tv you pick up on all of the little background things you never notice. With music, you can actually hear the singer take the smallest of breaths where you couldn\\'t before. Again, ours are tweaked for our phones and computers, BUT they are NOT tweaked for our tv, it\\'s impossible there and we still catch every little thing.So far, the hinges are holding up. Before we purchased these for our son, we actually went to Best Buy and looked at all of the models and different brands. Skull Candy, overall, were the best for the money and comfort out of all their in-store models. When we compared these to the Venues, we went with these because they feel far more substantial than the Venues. These are heavier and feel/seem to be made sturdier than the Venues. It seems to me the only differences in the two models are - ear pieces twist out on the Venue not on the Crusher, Venue has noise cancelling and Crushers do not, Crusher has the added bass adjustment & Venues don\\'t, and finally, the Crusher seems far strudier/a bit heavier/better made than the Venues and are cheaper than the Venues.I dont think these would be ideal for jogging or running...but I dont run anymore unless it\\'s for my life - so, I dont run. Lol. If you put them on and tap the outside of the can, you can hear it \"reverberating\". And I\\'ve seen other reviews about hearing that while running due to the jolt of the \"bouncing\" of the body while jogging. That would irritate me. They are a little heavy, but you get used to that quickly and they are super comfy so the weight never was a bother to to me nor my husband or son. We all wear glasses/contacts. They do not hurt my ears where my earpieces are. The cups are super cushy and they only get softer/better over time. Keep in mind, these are NOT noise cancelling. But, my husband often listens to loud music 2 feet away from me and I can\\'t say I can readily identify what he\\'s listening to unless I got closer, so again, it\\'s not a noticeable issue for me. When our toddler comes and crawls into bed with us, if we are watching tv, we have them on pretty loud, and it doesn\\'t bother her a bit, even when she\\'s got her head on my arm. Noises bother her if she\\'s trying to go to sleep. She would, very loudly, have said something by now if she heard any sound from the headphones, or heard it loud enough. She has not.I have paid 3 different prices for these each time I purchased them. 120 for our son, 108 for hubs, and I picked them up on Cyber Monday for 79.99. Even at 120, I would buy them again and would\\'ve happily paid it for the 2nd and 3rd pairs. They are holding up really well, have great sound, and fold up for smaller storage. They come with a nice little bag that holds them, but if you want any kind of real protection so you can throw them in a bag and go, I would invest in a hard shell case for them. The bag won\\'t protect them other than keeping them put away when not in use at home. The charge cord is good and seems to be good quality and the aux cord it comes with is really nice! The part under the jack is like a box and causes less stress on the jack and plug so it wont short out as easy. I really love the design of the auxillary cord.If you aren\\'t too terribly rough on headphones and plan on using these for a range of things - like calls, music, & hooking into the tv - these are DEFINITELY the cans for you! They are WELL worth their price, whatever that may be. I would just invest in a hard shell case and take care of them. Most of the breakage issues I saw in reviews were with the white ones. Other colors, in my opinion, dont have enough reviews with enough time in use to be confident that they wont do the same thing the white ones seems to do. We have had zero issues with our 3 sets in black, with one son who isnt always as careful as he should be with the more expensive stuff he wants lol, and they\\'ve held up to him perfectly. These are definitely worth your hard earned money! Skull Candy did good with these!!! I would give them my money again if I needed a 4th pair for any reason. Just go on and buy them!!!!',\n",

Its very loud, very physically demanding, very draining.So I listen to music and podcasts. But I hate earbuds, they irritate my ears and provide terrible quality. When they aren\\'t fighting Bluetooth to the death to not be paired.Headphones are better, but are larger, and need to be charged.This was the answer to all of my problems.Battery life? ALL WEEK BABY. I charge it on the weekends (Make sure to unplug it soon after its fully charged, preserves that beautiful battery) and it lasts ALL WEEK. 5-8 hours of playback PER DAY.Weight? Great! It doesn\\'t feel like its going to fly off of my head when I need to bend over or get on my hands and crawl to reach something. But its light enough that if I really want to, I can just shake it off of my head.Bass? Absolutely ridiculous. I don\\'t use it, except maybe for 10 seconds for fun. Have you ever heard those cars stroll by with speakers rattling the entire neighborhood? Yeah, that\\'s what they put in these things.I seen lots of reviews about these headphones being flimsy. Maybe it was a specific factory, but these things hold out great. They handle being tossed around and going through an X-ray twice a day, every day. No holidays, my job sucks. But these headphones dont!Out of the 2ish years vie been using these headphones, I have experienced very minimal issues. Occasionally, it disconnects from Bluetooth. Like, once every few months. And its fixed by unpairing and repairing to my phone.I only really have one complaint. The low battery signal. Most Bluetooth devices start yelling at you in a stock woman\\'s voice \"Battery low\" when its 10% or lower. The thing is, 10% on these beasts is still like 5-8 more hours. So that means ive had entire shifts that start and end with this woman shouting BATTERY LOW in 5 minute intervals. Its just a simple firmware thing they copy and paste onto all the headphones they make, but I really wish they tweaked it to happen at 5% or 3%, so it could actually indicate the battery being low.But overall, if you want nice quality headphones that will run a whole work week without needing to be charged, buy these.',\n",

       "  'review': \"UPDATE (7/23/18):  I've had these for about 3-4 days.  I wrote a glowing review based on my first day of use.  Although,  I'm afraid after a few hours of use I have to say these aren't worth the money and not something I would use or could use.  Here are a list of things I realized and found out after using them.1.  They literally crush your head.  They are very tight.  My son who is 15 has a pair and I have a pair.  Both of us complained of getting headaches and almost nauseous due to how tight they are on your head.  I've heard of some saying that they loosen up over a period of use, but I'm not going to wait it out.  They. are. tight.2.  NO MID RANGE.  High's are highs and lows are lows... but no mid.  I tested the headphones with my PS4 playing Ghost Recon Wildlands and Far Cry 5 and the guns sound flat.  Yes, the bass is punching you in the head but that's about all you hear and feel.  I thought maybe I was crazy so I pulled out my Cloud 2's and switched back and forth for about 30 minutes.  I shot guns, threw grenades, tested the scope of sound (hearing ambient effects around you) and honestly, the Cloud 2's in my opinion kill these.  The Cloud 2's don't have the thunderous bass that the Crushers do but they have a awesome mid range where you can feel and hear the gun shot, grenade explosions, etc.  This only was one of the major reason's I couldn't keep the Crushers.  I cannot recommend these for gaming.  Especially for long sessions.3.  I can't pair them with my TV, PS4, XBOX One.  Yes I hear you can get a dongle to assist in pairing the Crushers but I don't want to go that route.  I did use the wire that comes with the Crushers but there's a difference in sound between wired and bluetooth.4.  Music sounds great .... For awhile.  I missed that mid-range and true bass.  These do not have true bass.  The bass is like listening to someone having a party behind a cement wall.  There's just something off about it.  You can only handle so much.5.  HERE's the one where I can honestly say the Crushers kick butt.  Pairing these with your iPad or iPhone and watching a action flick on Netflix.  Tested it with Star Wars and the explosions and dialogue sounded great.  Although, I did plug them into my PS4 controller via the wire that comes with it and tried watching Netflix and there seemed to be a loss in quality of sound.  Switched back to bluetooth through my iPad and boom sound was thunderous and movies haven't sounded better.  Like sitting in a IMAX theater.6.  All in all, we returned the Crushers.  For the money, I'd rather save some more cash and get some Astros with an AMP or use my Cloud 2's and hook them up through a small receiver which is also connected to my PS4 and turn those bad boys up and get all the bass I need but with Mid's and Highs.I just can't recommend these.  I think the reviews are like myself... blown away the first few hours but then reality sinks in and you kind of realize what your dealing with.  It's sort of a gimmick and you can get better headphones with a less bass and still be quite happy.Original Review:I did a week's worth of research looking all over the internet for anyone really going into detail on whether the Crushers were a good gaming headset.  Well, now that I have them, I can safely say...  OH YEAH!  So here's a quick backstory...  I have been on the search for a pair of headphones that would allow me to feel the explosions, feel the bones crunching.  I have tried the Playstation Golds, Clouds, Astros, Sans, Sonys and none of them really had a deep pounding bass.  Don't get me wrong, all of them are great headphones.  I specifically bought the Cloud II's because to me for the price they had the best balance of sound and bass.  Saying that,  my son came running out of Best Buy and told me I had to try the Crushers.  Honestly, I laughed at him.  NO way.  I'll never buy Skull Candy or Beats.  Not for gaming.  I went anyway and holy crap did they rattle your head.  BUT, I still questioned whether they would produce good mid's and high's and would the bass actually sound good while gaming on my PS4.  So, my son ordered a pair on Amazon and they showed up today (7/19).  We plugged them into the PS4 and fired up Mad Max which has some awesome explosions and the cars rumble hard....  OH Man was it like nothing I've heard in a headphone.  The shotgun was deep and powerful.... The cars rumbled.  I mean rumbled.  Not a distorted bass but clean deep overpowering rumble.  Just awesome.So, after trying them and testing them...  A few things popped out...1.  The bass is truly something else.  Powerful.  I actually turned it all the way down to around 10% and it was just as good.  So imagine at 10% what it would feel like at 75%... It's nuts.2.  The PS4 has always had a issue with not really allowing headphones to really go 'LOUD'.  It's like it limits the volume to a certain extent and then stops.  You can't go louder.  Same scenario with the crushers.  I was loud but not as loud as I would like it.  I compared them to our cloud II's and same situation.  We are aware they are bluetooth but still trying to figure out how to connect them to the PS4.  I'm sure that would fix the volume issue.  So because of this... the mid's and high's weren't incredibly loud but completely doable.3.  Sound bleed was honestly very quiet.  My son had them cranked and I could not hear them.  Not bad.  So my wife won't get irritated while watching a movie on my iPad right next to her.4.  THINK IMAX SOUND in your ears while watching an action movie.  No joke, explosions and someone getting a kick in the face is felt.  John Wick and Equalizer is awesome with the crushers.Bottom line.  Well made, great sound, amazing bass like nothing I've heard.  For movies and games, no brainer in my book.  For music, even better.  BUT, keep in mind, it's not a true bass so for bass heads... these are awesome but for music purists...  I'd try something else.Gaming with these is just awesome.  Experience it.\",\n",

I really liked the bass on those (the vibrations are very soothing for my anxiety), though I didn't like how the ANC was controlled and I was constantly switching between the modes and brushing against the microphones on the sides. SO I figured that these headphones would be perfect since they don't include ANC. They are really different. The bass in these is intense compared to normal headphones, but it lacks the intense vibrations of the newer Crusher model. If ridiculous overwhelming bass is what you are excited about, get the newer model. On construction, this model seems sturdier, as there are no joints to break (some parts of the joint on my other pair have broken). I'll continue to use both, but the newer Crusher will still be my go-to for relieving anxiety.\",\n",

They feel really tight even after 6 months of use.Another problem is it's connectability. Sometimes they connect automatically but the sound is off... like it doesn't sound right until I disconnect and reconnect. It's not all the time and it's not the biggest issue since it gets fixed as soon as I reconnect, but still, I wish it weren't a problem to begin with.Other than my two issues, I highly recommend these if you don't want to break the bank. They sound amazing, have a LONG battery life, are very durable, and are not too expensive for how good they are.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Whenever I got these almost 2 years ago, I was lucky enough to catch a deal at 150 dollars down from the original 199.Fast forward to now, I was curious to see what black friday deals were going for these. 99 dollars is a steal just for the sound quality and battery life alone. I\\'m going on 2 years of fairly heavy use (I have these on all the time in my house except sleeping) and I often use them as a hairband doing stuff around the house if we\\'re being honest. The range is exceptional. I had very low expectations whenever it came to the range, but after investing in one of the higher grade usb dongles (only 12 bucks or so) I can get signal through 3-4 walls 40 feet away consistently. Other bluetooth devices I had issues going through a single wall and resyncing properly.That being said, while these look rugged they will develop hairline cracks around the housing that holds the cans even if you baby them. It\\'s fully plastic from the cans to the steel band in the headband. While I was first irritated with the build quality, I began to learn just how to combat this common issue and currently feel much better with everything from the fit to the durability of them since. You will learn very quickly upon learning of an issue with a skullcandy product that the warranty has a lot of loopholes............so anything other than a complete technical failure of a feature is not covered whatsoever. Moreso, I believe there\\'s even shipping that a customer would have to pay for pending a replacement or fix of an above mentioned technical failure.I tried superglue, I wasn\\'t concerned with the cosmetic look, it didn\\'t work. I tried using sparingly amounts of jbweld (5 dollars for 2x1oz tubes of steel reinforced epoxy) that would work temporarily until eventually I had a complete separation as seen in many of those pictures on this page. That\\'s when I just unapologetically gooped the jbweld all over the joint. It worked so well that a week later I intentional broke the other side (that I was having to baby for fear of breakage) just to goop it up with jbweld. Going for a rough break I was able to completely fuse all of those problem parts that tend to break, and I wish I would have done it sooner. It took time and a lot of nerves to get through, but it was well worth it.I ended up completely caking the joint and letting it cure carefully (because it\\'s pretty rigid after using it) two different times on each side to ensure it was able to fully cure and have enough support to keep the joint straight. It\\'s been 6 months or so since I \"fixed\" them and I\\'m not worried in the least about them breaking again.Another issue that could be unique to my headphones but I wanted to mention is the haptic bass switch. I\\'ve seen other reports of the switch being loose feeling and finicky. I\\'ve had the same issue from early on with my pair. I believe it\\'s fairly common and remedied with patience, but I try my best to keep the switch from fully engaged or fully disengaged as there seems to be some disconnect of the wires if you\\'re not careful. Also, it\\'s worth mentioning to use the enhancements and \"bass boost\" in options if you feel like you can\\'t find a good balance of haptic bass using the switch. Personally I have it set to boost 80hz and below by 3 db, and that lets the switch cover all the bases (puns).I\\'m glad I have these crushers rather than the hesh 2 bluetooth design for sound quality and comfort, but if you wanted to have something to use in the gym and toss in a bag or to keep in your car without worrying about breaking them, I would definitely go with the hesh 2 variety. The bluetooth hadn\\'t come out yet whenever I got my hesh 2s but I\\'ve had them for 4 years and they\\'re still a functional semi-comfortable wired headphones with decent sound. If you\\'re on the go I wouldn\\'t want to have the crushers on anyways because they do block so much ambient sound.In closing, if I felt like my current pair wouldn\\'t stand the test of time I\\'d buy 2 at this price today just for the love of the sound quality, ear comfort, passive noise canceling, and powerful-and-versatile haptic bass. If you\\'re a fan of chillstep, futurebass, or trance music these are a godsend. Other than the general build quality the only other thing I could see skullcandy on doing to improve these headphones is selling an accessory that turned the headset into a pillow you could sleep in, they\\'re that comfortable.Instead of some \"insurance plan\" that you\\'ll never qualify for or want to mess with, I\\'d instead buy some jbweld that matches the finish you buy and remember to check for cracks before they get out of hand or hard to manage everytime you plug in to charge them.
