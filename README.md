# Data-Mining

## Introduciton
The purpose of this project is to analyze customer sentiment towards products using data mining techniques and sentiment analysis. The project aims to extract meaningful insights from customer reviews and ratings, and use them to improve product recommendations and customer satisfaction.

## Data Source
The data used in this project comes from customer reviews and ratings of Amazon product. The data has been collected and preprocessed to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and convert it into a suitable format for analysis.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Before the data could be analyzed, it underwent several cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure accuracy and consistency. These steps included:
- Removing duplicates and irrelevant reviews
- Handling missing values and inconsistent data
- Converting the data into a suitable format for analysis
- Tokenizing and stemming the text data

## Methodology
The project uses a combination of data mining and sentiment analysis techniques to analyze customer sentiment. The steps involved include:
- Sentiment analysis of customer reviews using NLTK, Sentiment Intensity Analyzer and TextBlob techniques to determine the sentiment expressed in each review.
- Data mining techniques, such as association rule mining and clustering, to extract meaningful insights from the sentiment analysis results.

## Results
The results of the analysis show that customer sentiment towards products is highly influenced by product features and overall customer experience. The findings also reveal that customers are more likely to leave positive reviews for products that meet their expectations, and negative reviews for products that do not.

## Future Work
In the future, the project could be improved by incorporating additional data sources, such as customer behavior data, to further refine the analysis. The project could also be extended to include more advanced NLP techniques, such as sentiment classification, to improve the accuracy of the sentiment analysis.

## Tools & Dependencies
The project was implemented using Python and the following libraries:
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
- NLTK for natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
- Numpy for on numbers.
- PyMongo for interacting with MongoDB.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the importance of analyzing customer sentiment to improve product recommendations and customer satisfaction. The findings provide valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences, and highlight the potential of data mining and sentiment analysis in the e-commerce industry.
